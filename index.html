                <p class="text-muted text-left">One of the oldest Monastery in Darjeeling. It is situated in peaceful and beautiful landscape just 15 minutes walk from Ghoom Railway Station. We can see religious God and Goddess paintings believed by Buddhism inside which can give spiritual power to one who prays there with clean heart. From the compound of Monastery on a clear day one can have a scenery of hills all around which is great for nature lovers.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">It's a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Must haired tour guide so it will be batter to under stand all the things. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>

However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.</p>
